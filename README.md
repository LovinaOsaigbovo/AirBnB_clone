# AirBnB_clone
/**
 * In this repo, I am trying to clone the Airbnb website as Hbnb
 * First, I will create the backend using Python
 * I will temporarily store my data in storage engines pending when I learn SQL.
 * My Python objects willl then be converted to JSON and then to Javascript.
 * Javascript objects will be recognised by Html and CSS for the frontend.
